        <p>
            THE GIANT panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin:
            dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the <b>PANDA BEAR</b> or simply the panda,
            is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear">bear</a>[6] native to south central China.[1]
        </p>

        <p>
            It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the
            ears, and across its round body.
        </p>

        <p>
            The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red
            panda, a neighboring musteloid.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
            with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo">bamboo</a> shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[7]
        </p>

        <p>
            Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild
            tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
        </p>

        <p>
            In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves,
            oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

        <h1>Diet</h1>

        <p>
            Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous,
            consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[45] 
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific
            genes,[49] and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo.
        </p>

        <p>
            Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[50][51] Pandas are born with sterile
            intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[52]
        </p>

        <p>
            The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for
            millions of years.[53]
